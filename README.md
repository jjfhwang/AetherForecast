# AetherForecast: Algorithmic Forex Signal Generation with Bayesian Inference

AetherForecast is a sophisticated, real-time algorithmic trading platform engineered for generating high-probability Forex trading signals. It leverages advanced Bayesian inference techniques in conjunction with stochastic volatility models to analyze market dynamics and predict future price movements. The platform is designed for robustness, scalability, and adaptability to changing market conditions. Integrated with Kafka streams, AetherForecast allows for real-time data ingestion and signal dissemination, providing a comprehensive solution for automated Forex trading strategies.

This project aims to bridge the gap between complex statistical modeling and practical trading applications. By employing Bayesian methods, AetherForecast incorporates prior knowledge and continuously updates its beliefs based on incoming market data, leading to more accurate and reliable signal generation compared to traditional technical analysis. The inclusion of stochastic volatility models captures the time-varying nature of market risk, allowing the system to adapt to periods of high and low volatility, ultimately improving risk-adjusted returns. The real-time backtesting framework provides a crucial feedback loop for model validation and optimization.

AetherForecast is not just a signal generator; its a complete system for developing, testing, and deploying algorithmic trading strategies. The backtesting framework provides extensive performance metrics, allowing users to evaluate the efficacy of different model configurations and parameter settings. The modular architecture of the system enables users to easily customize and extend the functionality by incorporating new data sources, models, and trading strategies. This flexibility ensures that AetherForecast remains a valuable tool for traders of all skill levels, from beginners looking to automate their trading to experienced quants seeking to enhance their existing strategies.

**Key Features**

*   **Bayesian Inference Engine:** Implements Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, specifically the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, for parameter estimation in stochastic volatility models. Utilizes a Gaussian process prior for the volatility surface, enabling smooth and realistic volatility estimates.
*   **Stochastic Volatility Modeling:** Employs the Heston stochastic volatility model to capture the mean-reverting behavior of volatility and its impact on asset prices. Calibrated using historical data and updated in real-time with incoming market information.
*   **Real-time Data Ingestion via Kafka:** Integrates seamlessly with Kafka streams for real-time market data ingestion from multiple sources (e.g., brokers, data vendors). Supports various data formats (e.g., JSON, Protobuf) and customizable data processing pipelines.
*   **Comprehensive Backtesting Framework:** Provides a robust backtesting environment for evaluating the performance of different trading strategies under various market conditions. Generates detailed performance reports, including profit/loss (P/L) curves, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and transaction costs.
*   **Real-time Signal Generation & Dissemination:** Generates trading signals based on the output of the Bayesian inference engine and the stochastic volatility models. Disseminates signals in real-time via Kafka topics, enabling integration with automated trading platforms.
*   **Modular Architecture:** Designed with a modular architecture that allows for easy customization and extension of the system. Users can add new data sources, models, and trading strategies without modifying the core codebase.
*   **Customizable Risk Management:** Includes customizable risk management parameters such as position sizing, stop-loss orders, and take-profit orders. Allows users to tailor the risk profile of their trading strategies to their individual preferences.

**Technology Stack**

*   **Rust:** The core of AetherForecast is written in Rust, leveraging its performance, memory safety, and concurrency features for optimal execution speed and reliability.
*   **Kafka:** Used for real-time data ingestion, signal dissemination, and inter-process communication. Provides a scalable and fault-tolerant messaging infrastructure.
*   **ndarray:** Rust library for efficient multi-dimensional array manipulation, crucial for numerical computations involved in Bayesian inference and stochastic volatility modeling.
*   **rand:** Rust library providing a wide variety of random number generators, essential for MCMC simulations.
*   **serde:** Rust library for serializing and deserializing data structures, used for data ingestion and signal dissemination with Kafka.
*   **tokio:** Rust's asynchronous runtime, allowing for concurrent processing of market data and signal generation.
*   **log/env_logger:** Rust crates for logging and debugging, providing valuable insights into system behavior.

**Installation**

1.  Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. You can download them from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Verify the installation with:
    cargo --version
    rustc --version

2.  Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/AetherForecast.git
    cd AetherForecast

3.  Build the project:
    cargo build --release

4.  Install Kafka (if not already installed). Follow the instructions on the Apache Kafka website: [https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart). Ensure that a Kafka broker is running.

**Configuration**

AetherForecast relies on several environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following variables (example values provided):

KAFKA_BROKER=localhost:9092
DATA_TOPIC=market_data
SIGNAL_TOPIC=trading_signals
RISK_TOLERANCE=0.05
INITIAL_CAPITAL=10000

*   `KAFKA_BROKER`: The address of the Kafka broker.
*   `DATA_TOPIC`: The Kafka topic to subscribe to for market data.
*   `SIGNAL_TOPIC`: The Kafka topic to publish trading signals to.
*   `RISK_TOLERANCE`: The risk tolerance parameter for position sizing (e.g., 0.05 means no more than 5% of capital at risk per trade).
*   `INITIAL_CAPITAL`: The initial capital for backtesting and live trading simulations.

**Usage**

To run the AetherForecast system, execute the compiled binary:

./target/release/aetherforecast

This will start the system, which will subscribe to the `DATA_TOPIC` on Kafka, process the incoming market data, generate trading signals, and publish them to the `SIGNAL_TOPIC`.

The backtesting framework can be accessed through a command-line interface. Run `./target/release/aetherforecast --backtest <configuration_file.toml>` to initiate a backtest using the specified configuration file. The configuration file should define parameters such as the backtesting period, asset to trade, and initial capital.

The source code contains detailed documentation for all modules and functions. Examine the source code for specific API details and customization options.
